``` {#options .lua}
return {
  raw_attribute = true,
  fenced_code_blocks = true,
}
```

From the lunamark docs:

> When enabled, inline code and fenced code blocks with a special kind
> of attribute will be parsed as raw content with the designated format,
> e.g.Â `{=format}`. Writers may pass relevant raw content to the target
> formatter.
>
> To use a raw attribute with fenced code blocks, `fenced_code_blocks`
> must be enabled.
>
> As opposed to the Pandoc option going by the same name, raw attributes
> can be continued with key=value pairs.
>
> How these constructs are honored depends on the writer. In the minimal
> case, they are ignored, as if they were stripped from the input.
